    <h1>üêç Learn Python</h1>

    <p>Python is a powerful, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes readability and reduces the cost of program maintenance, making it a great choice for beginners and professionals alike.</p>

    <p>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a large and active community and is used by organizations like Google, NASA, Netflix, and Dropbox.</p>

    <p>Python‚Äôs syntax is designed to be intuitive and mirrors the English language to some extent. This readability makes it easier to learn and understand. Python is often recommended as the first programming language for aspiring developers.</p>

    <p>Python is used in many domains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Web development (Django, Flask)</li>
      <li>Data science and analysis (Pandas, NumPy)</li>
      <li>Machine learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)</li>
      <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
      <li>Desktop applications</li>
      <li>Automation and scripting</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here‚Äôs a simple Python program:</p>
    <pre>
print("Hello, world!")
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Nice to meet you, {name}!")
    </pre>

    <p>Python files typically use the `.py` extension. You can run Python programs using an interpreter like CPython or a development environment like VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook.</p>

    <p>Python‚Äôs extensive standard library provides tools for string operations, file I/O, networking, and more. Third-party packages can be installed via `pip`, Python‚Äôs package manager.</p>

    <p>Some core concepts in Python include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Variables and data types</li>
      <li>Control flow (if/else, loops)</li>
      <li>Functions and modules</li>
      <li>Classes and objects</li>
      <li>Exception handling</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Python is constantly evolving, with improvements and new features added in major releases (e.g., Python 3.11). Staying updated with documentation and community tutorials is helpful for growth.</p>

    <p>If you‚Äôre just starting out, websites like W3Schools, Real Python, and Codecademy offer excellent Python tutorials.</p>
