    <h1>üí° What is Programming?</h1>
    <p>Programming is the process of creating instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions, known as code, tell the computer what to do and how to perform specific tasks. Programming is a fundamental skill in computer science.</p>
    <p>A person who writes code is called a programmer. They use programming languages to communicate with computers. Some popular programming languages include Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and Ruby.</p>
    <p>Programming can be used to build software applications, websites, games, mobile apps, and more. It also powers the backend of systems like databases and cloud infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Core programming concepts include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Variables</strong> ‚Äì to store data</li>
      <li><strong>Control structures</strong> ‚Äì such as if-else statements and loops</li>
      <li><strong>Functions</strong> ‚Äì reusable blocks of code</li>
      <li><strong>Data structures</strong> ‚Äì arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithms</strong> ‚Äì step-by-step procedures to solve problems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Programming requires logical thinking, attention to detail, and creativity. It's a skill that improves with practice and experience.</p>
    <p>There are different styles or paradigms of programming:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Procedural programming</strong> ‚Äì based on procedures or routines</li>
      <li><strong>Object-oriented programming (OOP)</strong> ‚Äì based on objects and classes</li>
      <li><strong>Functional programming</strong> ‚Äì treats computation as the evaluation of functions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Programming is essential in fields such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and system administration.</p>
    <p>Beginners can start programming with user-friendly languages like Python, which have clear syntax and a large support community.</p>
    <p>Practicing with projects, coding challenges, and contributing to open-source code are excellent ways to improve programming skills.</p>
    <p>Understanding how to program empowers individuals to solve real-world problems with technology and build innovative applications.</p>
