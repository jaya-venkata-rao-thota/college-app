    <h1>üñ•Ô∏è What is a Computer?</h1>
    <p>A computer is an electronic device that can process, store, and retrieve data. It operates under the control of a set of instructions known as software. Computers can perform a wide variety of tasks, ranging from simple calculations to complex simulations.</p>
    <p>The fundamental components of a computer include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong> ‚Äì the brain of the computer, executing instructions.</li>
      <li><strong>Memory (RAM)</strong> ‚Äì temporary storage that helps the CPU access data quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage (Hard Drive or SSD)</strong> ‚Äì where data and programs are saved.</li>
      <li><strong>Input Devices</strong> ‚Äì such as a keyboard or mouse, used to provide data to the computer.</li>
      <li><strong>Output Devices</strong> ‚Äì like monitors and printers, which present data to the user.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are various types of computers: desktops, laptops, tablets, servers, and embedded systems. Each is designed for specific tasks and environments.</p>
    <p>Computers operate using binary code, which is a series of 0s and 1s. These binary digits represent instructions and data that are interpreted by the CPU.</p>
    <p>Software can be categorized into two types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>System software</strong> ‚Äì includes operating systems like Windows, macOS, or Linux, which manage hardware and system resources.</li>
      <li><strong>Application software</strong> ‚Äì programs like browsers, word processors, or games used to perform tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Modern computers are highly interconnected through networks and the internet, enabling global communication, data sharing, and distributed computing.</p>
    <p>With the rise of portable and embedded computing, devices like smartphones, smartwatches, and IoT gadgets have become commonplace, each functioning as a specialized computer.</p>
    <p>Computers continue to evolve rapidly, becoming faster, smaller, and more energy-efficient. They play a critical role in science, education, business, healthcare, and virtually every aspect of modern life.</p>
    <p>Understanding computers is fundamental to learning computer science, as it helps in grasping how hardware and software interact to solve problems and process data efficiently.</p>
