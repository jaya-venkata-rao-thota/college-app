    <h1>üåê What is Web Development?</h1>
    <p>Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications that are accessible via the Internet. It encompasses a wide range of tasks, from designing a simple static web page to developing complex web-based applications.</p>
    <p>Web development is divided into two main categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frontend development</strong> ‚Äì focuses on what users see and interact with. It includes layout, design, and interactivity using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
      <li><strong>Backend development</strong> ‚Äì involves server-side logic, databases, and server configuration. It powers the frontend and handles data processing and storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Modern web development often involves the use of frameworks and libraries:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frontend frameworks</strong>: React, Angular, Vue.js</li>
      <li><strong>Backend frameworks</strong>: Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Web developers use tools like code editors (VS Code), version control (Git), and browsers (Chrome, Firefox) to build and test websites.</p>
    <p>Key technologies include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HTML</strong> ‚Äì the structure of the webpage</li>
      <li><strong>CSS</strong> ‚Äì the styling and layout</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> ‚Äì interactivity and behavior</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Web hosting services make websites accessible on the internet. These include services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, and traditional hosting providers.</p>
    <p>Web development also requires knowledge of responsive design to ensure websites work on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.</p>
    <p>Security practices such as data encryption, authentication, and secure coding are critical for protecting users and data.</p>
    <p>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow web apps to communicate with external services, such as weather APIs, payment gateways, and social media platforms.</p>
    <p>Understanding SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is helpful for improving site visibility in search engines.</p>
    <p>With the rise of web technologies, Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are becoming popular, offering native app-like experiences directly through the browser.</p>
    <p>Web development is a dynamic field with constant evolution. Staying updated with the latest trends and tools is essential for modern developers.</p>
