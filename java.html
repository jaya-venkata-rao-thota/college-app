    <h1>☕ What is Java?</h1>
    <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It was designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, which means that Java applications can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
    <p>Java is known for its philosophy: <strong>Write Once, Run Anywhere</strong> (WORA). This portability has made it one of the most popular programming languages in the world.</p>
    <p>Key features of Java include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Object-Oriented</strong> – uses classes and objects to structure code</li>
      <li><strong>Platform Independent</strong> – runs on any platform using the JVM</li>
      <li><strong>Strongly Typed</strong> – enforces strict type checking</li>
      <li><strong>Automatic Memory Management</strong> – handles garbage collection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Java is widely used in a variety of applications including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Web Applications (via Java EE / Spring Framework)</li>
      <li>Mobile Applications (especially Android development)</li>
      <li>Desktop GUI Applications</li>
      <li>Enterprise-level backends</li>
      <li>Embedded Systems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A simple Java program looks like this:</p>
    <pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, Venkat!");
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>Java uses a compiler to convert code into bytecode, which is then interpreted by the JVM. This provides both performance and cross-platform capabilities.</p>
    <p>Java has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that support various fields such as networking, UI development, security, and concurrency.</p>
    <p>The Spring Framework, in particular, is very popular for building scalable, secure, and maintainable enterprise-level web applications.</p>
    <p>Java also promotes multithreading and concurrency, allowing developers to write programs that can perform many tasks at once.</p>
    <p>Over the years, Java has gone through several versions, each bringing new features and enhancements. As of now, Java continues to evolve and remains relevant in modern software development.</p>
    <p>Whether you're building web services, Android apps, or complex financial systems, Java is a reliable and widely supported language to learn and use.</p>
